# Duplicates
The Duplicates function disregards file names and dates, it uses a checksum to compare file contents. Only files that have exactly the same content are considered duplicates.
I use it most commonly to find duplicate pictures. Especially when sending pictures i already took with messenger apps, they often get copied again into an extra folder. Sometimes even multiple copies, one for each person I send the picture to. I usually only need one copy of the file so i use the duplicatefinder to remove the others.
Another common use case are music files. When organisin my mp3 files I tend to end up with the same tracks in multiple locations.
Now a lot of people ask which duplicates to delete, and while there are a few auto selection methods, there is no correct answer to this question.

Lets say you have two music albums called "Best running tracks of 2013" and "My favorite motorcycle music" and both obviously contain the track "Darken - Singing in the shower.mp3". You have the same file in two different locations. Now which one should be deleted, or none at all? I can't answer that and neither can SD Maid, only you can.
In any case the DuplicateFinder will make sure you always have one copy left.
