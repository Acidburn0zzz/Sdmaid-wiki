# Root
## What is root?
So what's this root everyone is talking about? Root is the name of a special user account on your device, a super user account with elevated privileges.
Normally you or apps can't use the account. The act of "rooting" changes that. It makes it accessible and adds a "superuser app" that manages access to the root account. There are pros and cons to rooting, which we don't need to cover here. Just google it, it's a common discussion on many blogs. Whether you root your device is up to you.

## Does SD Maid only work with root?
**No.** SD Maid will adjust it's behavior to fit your device. 

SD Maid being able to use root is a bonus for people with rooted devices. It does not make SD Maid work worse on unrooted devices.

Some people are saying: If you have rooted device you should use SD Maid, but if your device is not rooted, choose a different application. That's wrong. All applications are bound by the same restrictions, how each app uses what is has available, is what makes the difference.
Choose a different app if you don't feel comfortable using SD Maid, if it is too complicated or you simply don't like it, but not because you don't have a rooted device.

Functions that don't work at all without root are usually those that modify other apps, such as freezing or disabling components or uninstalling system apps.

## Does SD Maid only work on sdcards?
**No.** SD Maid will consider any accessible storage in your device. Depending on what can be accessed, this includes internal storage, external storage and usb storage.

## Why should I use SD Maid?

**Because it's thorough and honest.**
If you want a broom, you look for the one that cleans best, any other purchase argument is secondary. SD Maid v0.1 was released on [29.03.2011](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=12482608&postcount=1). Years of learning and more experience, constant improvements and adaption to every new Android kink, make SD Maid what is is today.
SD Maid is brutally honest, there will be no euphemisms to make your feel better after "cleaning" your device. No hidden agenda to pressure you into using the app itself. A tool to use when needed.

## SD Maid v2/v3/v4
There are different versions available of SD Maid. Every few years SD Maid was completely overhauled to improve it through gained experience and to adopt to new Android environments. During these overhauls the minimum required Android version is usually raised due reduce workload, maintaining compatibility "hacks" for very old Android versions is usually not feasible when supporting the newest Android versions.

It's possibly that newer versions seem slower but downgrading because of that is bad trade, you would gain speed but pay with thoroughness and safety. Searching through more and doing additional checks just costs time. Never versions may show less items to delete, not because they are worse, but because for specific reasons it is no longer considered good to remove these files. The goal is not to delete the most files, but the right files. Every change has a good reason.

In short: **Use the latest version of SD Maid available for your device.**
