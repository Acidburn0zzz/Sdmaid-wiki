The "Pro" version of SD Maid also called the "Unlocker" is a plugin, it's not a standalone application.
You should install it toegether with the free version of SD Maid and then start the version. It will detect the plugin and enable all extra features.

Pro features:
* User defined filters within the SystemCleaner
* AppCleaner tool
* Duplicates tool
* Scheduler
* QuickAccess widget
* File previews
* A searchable history of SD Maids actions

And of course it also supports my work and makes further development possible :tada:
